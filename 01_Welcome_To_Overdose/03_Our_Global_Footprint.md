# Our Global Footprint

From a basement in New Zealand to offices across the globe — Overdose has spread fast. But we didn't just expand for the sake of looking impressive on a map. Every office serves a strategic purpose, and our distributed model is central to how we deliver for clients.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify all Overdose office locations globally
- Understand why we chose each market
- Explain how our global presence benefits clients
- Describe how teams work across time zones

## Where We Are

Let's start with the geography. Overdose operates from offices across three major regions:

### Asia-Pacific (APAC)
- **Auckland, New Zealand** — Where it all began. Our original HQ and still a major hub for strategy and creative work.
- **Sydney, Australia** — Our largest office and the centre of our APAC operations.
- **Melbourne, Australia** — Key market presence serving Victoria and surrounding regions.
- **Brisbane, Australia** — Queensland operations and growing client base.
- **Singapore** — Southeast Asian hub for regional clients.

### Americas
- **Seattle, USA** — West Coast presence serving North American clients.
- **New York, USA** — East Coast operations and major brand partnerships.

### Europe
- **Kyiv, Ukraine** — Technical excellence hub with deep development capability.

## Why These Locations?

We didn't just throw darts at a map. Each location serves specific strategic purposes:

**Auckland:** Home turf. This is where the founders are based, where our culture was born, and where some of our longest-standing client relationships exist. New Zealand punches well above its weight in digital commerce, and we're proof of that.

**Australia (Sydney/Melbourne/Brisbane):** The natural first expansion. Similar culture, same time zones, massive retail market. Australia represents a huge chunk of our client base across fashion, lifestyle, and B2B sectors.

**Singapore:** Gateway to Southeast Asia. As brands in the region embrace digital commerce, we need local presence to support them. Plus, it gives us timezone coverage across more of Asia.

**USA (Seattle/New York):** The world's largest ecommerce market. You can't be a serious global player without US presence. Seattle gives us West Coast tech scene access; New York connects us to major retail and fashion brands.

**Kyiv:** Technical powerhouse. Ukraine has an incredible pool of development talent, and our Kyiv team handles some of our most complex platform builds. This isn't offshoring to cut costs — it's accessing world-class expertise.

## The Follow-The-Sun Advantage

Here's where our global footprint gets really interesting for clients: we can work around the clock.

When the Sydney team finishes their day, the Kyiv team is coming online. When Kyiv wraps up, Seattle is getting started. This means:

- **Faster turnaround** on urgent work
- **24-hour support** during critical periods (hello, Black Friday)
- **Continuous progress** on large projects
- **Flexibility** to match client timezone preferences

> **Tip:** If you're working on a project with tight deadlines, think about how to leverage our global team. That feature that needs to ship tomorrow morning? It might be able to get built tonight while you sleep.

## One Company, Many Locations

Being global creates challenges. How do you maintain culture across different countries? How do you ensure consistent quality? How do you make sure people actually feel connected?

Here's how we do it:

**Shared Systems:** Everyone uses the same tools, follows the same processes, and works from the same playbooks. Whether you're in Auckland or New York, the OD way of working is consistent.

**Regular Communication:** We're big on video calls, team channels, and async updates. Timezone differences don't mean isolation — they mean you need to be intentional about staying connected.

**Cross-Office Projects:** Most major client work involves people from multiple offices. You'll work with colleagues you've never met in person but who feel like teammates because of how closely you collaborate.

**Cultural Rituals:** Company-wide meetings, celebrations, and communications happen regardless of location. When we win a big pitch, everyone celebrates together.

## Working Across Cultures

Our global team means working with people from different backgrounds, communication styles, and cultural contexts. This is a feature, not a bug.

**What you'll notice:**
- Kiwi directness (we tell it like it is)
- Australian confidence (no shortage of opinions)
- American optimism (everything is achievable)
- Ukrainian technical precision (code quality matters)

> **Important:** Respect for cultural differences is essential at OD. Different doesn't mean wrong — it means diverse perspectives that make our work better.

## The Numbers

Let's put some scale on this:

- **450+ commerce professionals** globally
- **8+ office locations** across 3 continents
- **Thousands of clients** served since founding
- **Millions of dollars** in client revenue influenced

For a company founded in 2016, that's serious scale. But we're not done growing.

## How This Affects You

As a new starter, what does our global footprint mean for you?

**You'll work with global colleagues.** Expect calls at sometimes weird hours, Slack messages from people in different timezones, and collaboration across borders.

**Your work has global impact.** That campaign you help optimize might run in three countries. That site you help build might serve customers worldwide.

**You'll learn from diverse perspectives.** Our global team brings different experiences and approaches. Take advantage of that diversity.

**Career opportunities are global.** As we grow, opportunities open up in different markets. Your career at OD isn't limited to your current location.

## Regional Leadership

Each region has dedicated leadership to ensure local clients get local expertise:

- **Australia:** Laura Jackson (CEO Australia)
- **Americas:** Jenny Mesdag (CEO Americas)
- **Global Strategy:** Todd Welling coordinates across all regions

This structure means we're not just a New Zealand company with some overseas offices. We're genuinely global with real leadership depth in each market.
