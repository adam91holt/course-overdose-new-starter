![The OD Story](/courses/overdose-new-starter/assets/lesson-images/m1_01_od_story.jpg)

So you've joined Overdose. Nice one. Before you dive into the deep end of ecommerce madness, let's talk about where this whole thing started. Because understanding our roots isn't just corporate fluff — it's the DNA that shapes everything we do.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain when and why Overdose was founded
- Describe the company's explosive growth trajectory
- Understand what makes OD different from day one
- Articulate the core problem we set out to solve

## The Basement Origin Story

Every great company has an origin story. Apple had a garage. Amazon had a bookshelf. We had a client's basement.

Back in early 2016, two guys — Ryan Delaney and Todd Welling — decided they were sick of how digital agencies operated. They'd seen too many projects delivered "on time" and "on budget" that completely failed to move the needle for businesses. Expensive websites that looked like speedboats but performed like dinghies.

So they did what any self-respecting commerce nerds would do: they launched Overdose.Digital from literally nothing. In Year One, working hands-on out of a client's basement, they pulled in $500k in revenue. By Year Two? $8 million.

That's not a typo. That's what happens when you actually solve real problems.


## The Problem We Saw

Here's the thing about traditional digital agencies that drove us mental:

**The Broken Model:**
- Agencies got paid to deliver projects, not results
- Success was measured in milestones hit, not revenue generated
- Once a site launched, it was "set and forget"
- Clients were left with expensive tech that nobody maintained properly

The whole industry was built on a fundamentally broken incentive structure. Agencies made money by delivering stuff. Whether that stuff actually worked? Not really their problem.

> **The OD Insight:** We realized that if we tied our success to our clients' success, everything would change. If they win, we win. If they lose, we lose. Suddenly, you care a hell of a lot more about whether that checkout flow actually converts.

## From Zero to 450+

Let's talk growth, because ours has been... intense.

| Year | Team Size | Key Milestone |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 2016 | 2 founders | Launch from a basement |
| 2017 | ~20 | First real office |
| 2018 | 50+ | Expanded to Australia |
| 2020 | 220+ | Global presence across 8 locations |
| 2024 | 450+ | Industry-defining capability |

We didn't grow by playing it safe or doing what everyone else was doing. We grew by being genuinely useful to the businesses we worked with. Crazy concept, right?

## The Anti-Agency Manifesto

From day one, we positioned ourselves as the "Anti-Agency, Agency." That's not just marketing speak — it's a genuine rejection of how this industry typically operates.

Traditional agencies:
- Sell solutions first, understand problems later
- Celebrate launches, ignore long-term performance
- Work *for* clients at arm's length
- Get paid regardless of outcomes

Overdose:
- Diagnoses before prescribing
- Obsesses over continuous improvement
- Works *with* clients as embedded partners
- Ties compensation to actual results

> **Important:** When you tell someone at a party you work at an agency, they probably picture account managers in suits doing long lunches. That's not us. We're commerce nerds who happen to run a business.

## Why This Matters To You

You might be wondering why we're spending so much time on history. Here's why:

**Understanding where we came from helps you understand:**
- Why we reject "good enough" work
- Why we obsess over client outcomes
- Why we move fast and break conventions
- Why we hire people who give a damn

This company wasn't built by following playbooks. It was built by people who saw a broken industry and decided to fix it. That entrepreneurial, problem-solving spirit isn't just for the founders — it's expected from everyone here.

## The Revenue Revolution

One more thing about our origin: we fundamentally changed how agency-client relationships work financially.

Instead of:
- Fixed project fees
- Change requests and scope battles
- Adversarial budget conversations

We introduced:
- Distributed retainer models
- Shared risk and reward
- Collaborative commercial relationships

This means when our clients have a monster holiday season, we celebrate together. When things are tough, we tighten our belts together. Real partnership, not vendor-client theatre.

## Key Takeaways

- Overdose was founded in 2016 by Ryan Delaney and Todd Welling
- We grew from a basement operation to 450+ people in under a decade
- The company was built to solve the "broken agency model" problem
- Our Anti-Agency positioning isn't marketing — it's our operating philosophy
- We tie our success directly to client outcomes

## Next Steps

Now that you know where we came from, let's meet the people who made it happen. Next up: the founders and the leadership team who've shaped OD into what it is today.
