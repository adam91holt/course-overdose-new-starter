# Meet The Founders

Behind every great company are the people crazy enough to start it. At Overdose, that's Ryan Delaney and Todd Welling — two commerce veterans who met through the industry, saw its problems firsthand, and decided to build something better.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify the co-founders and their backgrounds
- Understand how their partnership formed
- Explain the complementary skills they brought to OD
- Recognize the founding vision that still drives us today

## How It All Started

The Ryan and Todd story begins in 2012 — four years before Overdose existed.

Todd Welling owned a digital agency focused on ecommerce development. Ryan Delaney was working as a graphic designer at Federation Clothing, a New Zealand fashion label. Todd's agency was contracted to help Federation with their digital presence, and that's where these two commerce nerds first crossed paths.

They hit it off. Not in a "let's grab a beer sometime" way, but in a "we think the same way about this industry" way. Over the next few years, they kept in touch, swapped ideas, and watched as the digital commerce space evolved — often in directions they thought were completely wrong.

By early 2016, they'd had enough of watching from the sidelines. Time to build something different.

## Ryan Delaney — Group Chief Experience Officer

Ryan's background is in design and brand experience. At Federation Clothing, he saw firsthand how creative decisions impact commerce outcomes. A beautiful website that doesn't convert is just expensive art.

**What Ryan Brings:**
- Deep understanding of consumer psychology
- Brand-first thinking that doesn't sacrifice performance
- Design leadership that connects creativity to commercial outcomes
- Experience in fashion and lifestyle commerce

Ryan now serves as Group Chief Experience Officer, leading our approach to UX, UI, and the overall customer journey. When you hear us talk about "consumer empathy" — that's Ryan's influence.

> **Ryan's Philosophy:** "Design isn't about making things pretty. It's about making things work beautifully."

## Todd Welling — Group Chief Strategy Officer

Todd came from the agency side. He'd run his own digital shop and knew exactly how the traditional model failed clients. He understood scope creep, budget battles, and the fundamental misalignment between agency incentives and client success.

**What Todd Brings:**
- Agency operational expertise
- Strategic thinking that connects digital to business outcomes
- Commercial acumen and partnership models
- Deep platform and technology knowledge

Todd now serves as Group Chief Strategy Officer, driving how we approach client relationships and business growth. The distributed retainer model? That's Todd's fingerprints all over it.

> **Todd's Philosophy:** "We don't deliver projects. We produce business outcomes."

## The Complementary Partnership

Here's why Ryan and Todd work so well together: they're not the same person.

| Ryan | Todd |
|------|------|
| Creative background | Agency operations background |
| Experience-focused | Strategy-focused |
| Consumer empathy | Commercial acumen |
| Design thinking | Business thinking |

This isn't a case of two founders who agree on everything. It's two people with different expertise who share the same values. They both believe:

- Client success is the only metric that matters
- Traditional agency models are broken
- Great work requires both creativity and strategy
- You should never deliver something you wouldn't be proud of

## The Early Days

Picture this: 2016, two guys with complementary skills, working out of a client's basement. No fancy office, no huge team, no safety net. Just the belief that they could do this better than the established players.

They did everything themselves at first:
- Client pitches
- Strategy development
- Design work
- Development oversight
- Project management
- Invoicing
- Taking out the rubbish

That hands-on, no-job-too-small mentality is still part of our DNA. Even as we've grown to 450+ people, the founders expect everyone to roll up their sleeves.

## What They Built Different

When Ryan and Todd started Overdose, they made some deliberate choices that set us apart:

**1. Outcomes Over Outputs**
From day one, they refused to celebrate project launches. The question was never "did we deliver?" but "did it work?" This obsession with results changed everything about how we operate.

**2. Partnership Over Vendor Relationships**
They didn't want clients — they wanted partners. People whose success was directly tied to OD's success. This meant turning down work that wasn't a good fit, even when the money was tempting.

**3. Global Thinking From Day One**
Even as a tiny operation, Ryan and Todd thought globally. They saw ecommerce as a borderless industry and built the company to operate across time zones from the start.

**4. Culture As Competitive Advantage**
They knew that the right people would build the right company. Hiring for cultural fit wasn't HR speak — it was survival strategy.

## The Founders Today

Ryan and Todd are still deeply involved in the business, but they've built a leadership team that shares their vision. They've moved from doing everything themselves to enabling others to do great work.

You might not interact with them daily, but their influence is everywhere:
- In how we pitch to clients
- In how we design solutions
- In how we measure success
- In how we treat each other

> **Important:** One thing the founders established early: this isn't a company where the bosses stay in ivory towers. Leadership is accessible, visible, and accountable.

## Lessons From The Founders

What can you learn from Ryan and Todd's story?

**Take the leap when you see opportunity.** They didn't wait for perfect conditions. They saw a problem, believed they could solve it, and started.

**Find partners who complement you.** The best teams aren't people who agree on everything. They're people who bring different strengths to shared goals.

**Stay close to the work.** Even as they've grown the business, Ryan and Todd still care about craft. They haven't lost touch with what makes great commerce work.

**Build culture intentionally.** The OD culture wasn't an accident. It was designed from day one to attract people who give a damn.
