![Awards And Recognition](/courses/overdose-new-starter/assets/lesson-images/m1_04_awards.jpg)

Talk is cheap. Anyone can claim they're the best. What matters is recognition from the industry, from partners, and from clients. Overdose has stacked up some serious credentials since 2016 — here's what we've achieved and what it means.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- List key awards and recognitions Overdose has received
- Understand what these awards represent
- Explain our partner status with major platforms
- Recognize why industry recognition matters for clients

## Major Awards

Let's start with the highlights. These aren't participation trophies — they're competitive awards that recognize genuine excellence.

### Deloitte Fast 500
**Fastest Growing Agency**

The Deloitte Technology Fast 500 ranks companies by revenue growth rate. Being named the Fastest Growing Agency in this ranking isn't about being big — it's about growing faster than everyone else. This award validated that our model works.

### Adobe Commerce Partner of the Year
**Digital Experience Partner of the Year**

Adobe Commerce (formerly Magento) is one of the world's leading ecommerce platforms. Their Partner of the Year award goes to agencies that demonstrate exceptional delivery, innovation, and client results. We've won this multiple times, which means we're consistently performing at the top tier.

### BigCommerce
**Marketing Solutions Partner of the Year**

BigCommerce is another major platform we work with. This award recognizes our ability to not just build stores, but to drive actual marketing performance for BigCommerce merchants.

### Westpac Business Awards
**Best of the Best Emerging Business**

This New Zealand business award recognized Overdose early in our journey as one of the country's most promising companies. It helped establish our reputation in our home market.

### Yotpo Partner Awards 2024
**Recognition for UGC and Reviews Excellence**

Our work leveraging Yotpo's platform for clients like Bart Group brands (James Lane and Sleeping Giant) earned recognition for driving customer engagement and revenue growth through reviews and user-generated content.


## What These Awards Actually Mean

Awards are nice for the trophy cabinet, but here's why they actually matter:

**For Clients:**
- Confidence they're working with a proven partner
- Assurance of platform expertise and certification
- Evidence of successful track record

**For The Industry:**
- Recognition that our anti-agency model works
- Validation of our approach to commerce
- Positioning as a thought leader

**For You:**
- You're joining a company with a track record
- Your work continues a legacy of excellence
- Your clients expect award-winning quality

> **Important:** Awards reflect past performance. What matters is maintaining and exceeding that standard. Every project you work on either adds to or detracts from our reputation.

## Platform Partnership Status

Beyond awards, our platform certifications and partner levels demonstrate deep expertise:

### Shopify Plus
**Solutions Partner since 2013**

We've been a Shopify Plus partner for over a decade — back when Shopify Plus was just getting started. Our history with the platform means deep expertise that newer partners can't match.

### Adobe Commerce
**Award-Winning Partner**

Adobe Commerce is complex enterprise territory. Our team includes certified developers, solution architects, and specialists who can handle the most demanding implementations.

### BigCommerce
**Elite Partner**

We achieved Elite Partner status with BigCommerce quickly after adopting the platform in 2018. This is the highest tier and requires demonstrated capability across multiple enterprise builds.

### Commercetools
**Certified Partner**

As headless and composable commerce grows, our Commercetools expertise positions us for the future of enterprise ecommerce architecture.

## Technology Partner Ecosystem

Beyond platforms, we're recognized partners with key technology providers:

| Partner | Expertise Area |
|---------|----------------|
| Klaviyo | Email & SMS Marketing |
| Dotdigital | Marketing Automation |
| Nosto | Personalization |
| Algolia | Search & Discovery |
| Yotpo | Reviews & UGC |
| Omneo | Customer Loyalty |
| Comestri | Product Information Management |

These aren't just badges on our website. Each partnership represents:
- Certified team members
- Direct relationship with partner teams
- Early access to new features
- Preferred pricing for clients

## Why Partner Status Matters

You might wonder: does it really matter if we're an "Elite Partner" vs a "Standard Partner"?

**Yes, it absolutely does.**

**Access:** Higher-tier partners get direct access to platform teams, beta features, and premium support. When something breaks at 2am on Black Friday, we can get help faster.

**Training:** We receive advanced training that standard partners don't get. Our team knows platform capabilities that others miss.

**Trust:** Enterprise clients won't work with unproven partners. These certifications open doors that would otherwise be closed.

**Results:** Partner status usually correlates with experience. We've done more implementations, solved more problems, and learned more lessons than lower-tier partners.

## Client Recognition

The most meaningful recognition comes from the people who pay our bills. Here's what clients have said:

Client testimonials matter more than industry awards because they reflect real-world experience. We don't just win awards — we win repeat business.

## The Continuous Bar

Here's the thing about recognition: it creates expectations. When you're known as an award-winning agency, every project carries that weight. Clients expect excellence because we've told them that's what we deliver.

That's good pressure. It keeps us honest.

**What this means for your work:**
- Good enough isn't good enough
- Every deliverable represents the OD brand
- Quality is non-negotiable
- Client outcomes drive everything

> **Tip:** When you're working on a project, ask yourself: "Would this win an award?" If not, it's not done yet.

## Building The Next Recognition

Awards and recognition aren't given — they're earned through:
- Exceptional client work
- Innovative solutions
- Measurable results
- Thought leadership

You have an opportunity to contribute to the next wave of OD recognition. The case study that wins next year's award might be the project you work on.
