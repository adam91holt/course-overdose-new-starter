You didn't join Overdose just to do a job — you joined to build a career. This lesson covers how we think about growth and development, and what opportunities exist for you to level up.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Understand the career development philosophy at Overdose
- Identify growth opportunities available to you
- Take ownership of your professional development
- Navigate the support systems for your growth

## Our Philosophy On Growth

Career development at Overdose isn't just HR speak — it's core to how we operate. Here's how we think about it:

### Growth Is Expected
We hire people with ambition. We expect you to want more — more responsibility, more impact, more expertise. Staying static isn't the goal.

### Growth Is Personal
Your path won't look like everyone else's. Some people want to go deep into specialization. Others want to broaden into leadership. Some want to switch disciplines entirely. We support different trajectories.

### Growth Is Partnership
You own your development, but you're not alone. Managers, mentors, and the company provide support. We invest in people who invest in themselves.

### Growth Is Continuous
Development isn't just about promotions. It's about getting better every day — at your craft, at collaboration, at impact.

> **The Deal:** You bring curiosity and effort. We bring opportunities and support.


## Types of Growth

Growth happens in multiple dimensions:

### Technical/Craft Growth
Getting better at your core skill. Deeper expertise, better quality, faster execution.

**Examples:**
- A developer mastering a new framework
- A designer learning advanced animation techniques
- A marketer getting certified in a new platform
- An analyst building advanced modeling skills

### Scope Growth
Taking on bigger challenges. More complex projects, more strategic thinking, higher stakes.

**Examples:**
- Moving from single-page optimization to full site redesigns
- Graduating from tactical execution to strategic planning
- Taking on enterprise clients after mid-market experience

### Leadership Growth
Developing others. Managing teams, mentoring colleagues, influencing direction.

**Examples:**
- Becoming a team lead
- Mentoring junior colleagues
- Leading initiatives beyond your immediate role
- Managing client relationships

### Cross-Functional Growth
Building breadth. Understanding disciplines beyond your core, becoming T-shaped.

**Examples:**
- A developer learning UX principles
- A marketer understanding technical SEO
- A designer learning to interpret analytics

## Career Pathways

Different paths exist depending on your interests:

### Individual Contributor Track
Going deep on craft. Becoming a recognized expert in your domain without managing people.

**Progression example (Development):**
Junior Developer → Developer → Senior Developer → Lead Developer → Principal Developer → Distinguished Engineer

### Management Track
Leading people. Building teams, developing others, driving organizational outcomes.

**Progression example:**
Senior [Role] → Team Lead → Manager → Director → VP

### Hybrid Paths
Some roles combine deep expertise with leadership. Technical leads, creative directors, and similar positions blend mastery with management.

**Important:** Neither track is "better." What matters is finding the path that fits your strengths and interests.

## Taking Ownership

Your career development is primarily your responsibility. Here's how to own it:

### Know What You Want
Think about where you're headed. Not precise predictions, but direction. Do you want to lead people? Go deep on a specialty? Move into strategy? Clarity helps you make decisions.

### Communicate Your Ambitions
Tell your manager what you're aiming for. They can't help if they don't know. Career conversations shouldn't be surprises during reviews.

### Seek Opportunities
Volunteer for stretch projects. Ask to be involved in new areas. Raise your hand for challenges. Opportunities go to those who want them.

### Learn Continuously
Read, take courses, attend conferences, experiment. Learning doesn't stop after formal education. The best professionals are lifelong learners.

### Ask For Feedback
Actively seek input on how you're doing. Don't wait for reviews. Regular feedback accelerates improvement.

> **Tip:** The people who grow fastest are proactive about their development. Waiting to be developed is slower than developing yourself.

## Company Support

While you own your growth, we provide support:

### Manager Conversations
Regular 1:1s with your manager should include career discussions. What are you learning? Where do you want to go? What support do you need?

### Performance Reviews
Formal reviews provide structured feedback on your progress and development areas. These aren't surprises — they synthesize ongoing conversations.

### Learning Resources
Access to training platforms, conferences, certifications, and learning materials. Ask your manager about what's available.

### Mentorship
Both formal and informal mentorship. Senior colleagues who can guide your development based on their experience.

### Project Assignments
Intentional placement on projects that build specific skills. We try to match development goals with project opportunities.

### Internal Mobility
Opportunities to move between teams, disciplines, or regions. If your growth path leads elsewhere in OD, we support internal moves.

## Practical Development Actions

Concrete steps you can take:

### This Quarter

### This Year

## Growth Mindset

Underlying all of this is mindset:

### Embrace Challenge
Hard things help you grow. If everything is easy, you're not stretching.

### Learn From Failure
Mistakes are learning opportunities. The only bad failure is one you don't learn from.

### Seek Feedback
Feedback is a gift. Even critical feedback helps you improve.

### Persist
Growth takes time. Don't expect overnight transformation. Consistent effort compounds.

### Celebrate Progress
Acknowledge your growth. It's easy to focus on gaps instead of gains.
