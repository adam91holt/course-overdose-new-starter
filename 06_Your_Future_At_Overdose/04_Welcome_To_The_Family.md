![Welcome To The Family](/courses/overdose-new-starter/assets/lesson-images/m6_04_welcome.jpg)

You made it. You've learned our story, our services, our clients, our culture, how we work, and where we're heading. Now it's time to close out with what really matters: you're part of this now.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Feel genuinely welcomed to Overdose
- Understand your role in the bigger picture
- Know where to go from here
- Feel ready to start making your mark

## You Belong Here

Let's be direct: we hired you because we believe you can contribute something valuable. You went through a selection process designed to find people who fit our culture and have the skills to succeed. You passed.

That means:
- **Your perspective matters.** We didn't hire you to stay quiet.
- **Your questions are welcome.** There are no stupid questions from someone new.
- **Your growth is our investment.** We want you to succeed because it benefits everyone.
- **Your challenges are shared.** When you struggle, ask for help. That's what teams are for.

> **The Bottom Line:** You're not an outsider trying to fit in. You're a new member of a family that's glad you're here.


## The OD Family

"Family" might sound like corporate cheese, but it's genuinely how we think about this place.

**Family means:**
- We look out for each other
- We celebrate wins together
- We support each other through hard times
- We give honest feedback because we care
- We stay connected across distances and time zones
- We build something together that's bigger than any individual

**Family doesn't mean:**
- Putting up with bad behavior
- Working yourself to exhaustion
- Ignoring professional boundaries
- Treating the company as your entire identity

We want sustainable, healthy relationships — not dysfunctional dependency.

## Your Part In The Story

Overdose was built by people who saw problems and decided to fix them. Ryan and Todd in a basement, deciding the agency model was broken. Every person who joined after, adding their skills and perspectives.

Now you're part of that story.

**What came before you:**
- Founders who took a risk
- Early employees who built the foundation
- Clients who trusted us when we were small
- People who developed the processes you'll use
- Culture carriers who established how we do things

**What you add:**
- Fresh perspective
- Your unique skills
- New ideas and approaches
- Your energy and ambition
- The next chapter of the story

**What comes after:**
- People you'll mentor someday
- Clients you'll help succeed
- Processes you'll improve
- Culture you'll strengthen
- Impact that outlasts your tenure

## What We Need From You

Being specific about expectations:

### Bring Your Best
Not perfection. Not working yourself into the ground. Just genuine effort to do excellent work.

### Stay Curious
Keep learning. Commerce evolves fast. The people who stay curious stay relevant.

### Be Kind
Competition is external. Inside, we support each other. Kindness is strength, not weakness.

### Speak Up
See something wrong? Say something. Have an idea? Share it. Notice someone struggling? Offer help.

### Deliver
At the end of the day, we're here to produce results. Meet your commitments. Ship your work. Create value.

### Care
About your work. About clients. About colleagues. About the company. Care shows in everything.

## What You Can Expect From Us

The commitment goes both ways:

### Support
When you need help, you'll get it. From your manager, your team, your colleagues across the company.

### Growth Opportunities
Chances to learn, stretch, advance. We invest in people who invest in themselves.

### Honest Feedback
You'll know where you stand. Constructive criticism and genuine praise.

### Flexibility
Life happens. We work hard, but we also understand that work isn't everything.

### Recognition
Good work gets noticed. We celebrate wins and acknowledge contributions.

### Fair Treatment
Respect, equity, and professionalism. Always.

## Resources For Your Journey

**Day-to-day questions:** Your manager and immediate team

**HR matters:** People & Culture team

**Technical issues:** IT support

**Career development:** Your manager + People & Culture

**Client concerns:** Your Client Partner or project lead

**Culture questions:** Anyone — culture is everyone's responsibility

**Learning resources:** Ask your manager about available platforms and budgets

## A Final Word

Overdose was built by people who gave a damn. People who saw a better way and made it happen. People who cared about craft, about clients, about colleagues.

You're now one of those people.

What you do from here shapes not just your career but the company itself. Every deliverable, every conversation, every decision either adds to or subtracts from what we're building.
