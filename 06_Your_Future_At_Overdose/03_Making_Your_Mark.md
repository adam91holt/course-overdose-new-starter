You've joined Overdose. You understand our history, culture, and direction. Now the question is: what impact will YOU make? This lesson is about moving from new starter to valued contributor to someone who shapes the company.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify ways to create impact at Overdose
- Build visibility for your contributions
- Shape the company beyond your immediate role
- Balance individual ambition with team success

## From New Starter to Contributor

The transition from new to established happens through consistent value creation.

### First 30 Days: Learning Mode
Your job is to absorb. Understand how things work, build relationships, get up to speed. It's okay to not contribute much yet — learning IS your contribution.

**Focus on:**
- Understanding your role and responsibilities
- Learning tools and processes
- Building relationships with your team
- Asking questions (lots of them)

### Days 30-90: Contributing Mode
You start adding value. Complete tasks well, meet deadlines, help teammates. You're not just learning — you're producing.

**Focus on:**
- Delivering quality work on time
- Taking on increasing responsibility
- Starting to contribute ideas
- Building credibility through consistency

### Days 90+: Impact Mode
You're fully operational. Time to think about broader impact. How can you make things better, not just do things well?

**Focus on:**
- Going beyond task completion
- Identifying improvement opportunities
- Taking initiative on projects
- Building your reputation

> **The Timeline Is Flexible:** Some people move faster, some slower. The phases are guideposts, not rigid rules.


## Ways To Create Impact

Impact isn't one-dimensional. Multiple paths exist:

### Craft Excellence
Become known for exceptional quality in your domain. The go-to person for a specific capability.

**How to do it:**
- Deliver consistently excellent work
- Go deeper on your specialty
- Share expertise with others
- Build a portfolio of great work

### Client Impact
Become someone clients love working with. Known for understanding their business and delivering results.

**How to do it:**
- Invest in understanding client businesses
- Communicate proactively
- Deliver on promises
- Celebrate client wins

### Process Improvement
Make things work better. Identify inefficiencies and fix them.

**How to do it:**
- Notice friction points
- Propose solutions, not just problems
- Get buy-in and implement changes
- Measure the improvement

### Culture Contribution
Strengthen what makes OD special. Model values, support colleagues, build community.

**How to do it:**
- Embody OD values consistently
- Help new people integrate
- Contribute to team morale
- Speak up when culture drifts

### Innovation
Bring new ideas. Try new approaches, experiment, push boundaries.

**How to do it:**
- Stay curious about new tools and techniques
- Propose experiments
- Learn from failures
- Share learnings widely

### Mentorship
Develop others. Your growth multiplies when you help others grow.

**How to do it:**
- Share knowledge generously
- Offer guidance to junior colleagues
- Create documentation and training
- Be available for questions

## Building Visibility

Impact without visibility limits your career. You need people to know what you've accomplished.

### Document Your Work
Keep track of what you've done. Projects, results, positive feedback. You'll need this for reviews and career conversations.

### Share Proactively
Don't wait to be asked. Share wins, learnings, and interesting work in appropriate channels.

### Speak Up In Meetings
Contribute to discussions. Ask good questions. Offer perspectives. Presence in meetings builds visibility.

### Help Others Succeed
When colleagues succeed with your help, that reflects well on you. Support generously.

### Accept Recognition Gracefully
When you're praised, accept it. Don't deflect excessively. And pay it forward by recognizing others.

### Be Careful About Self-Promotion
There's a line between visibility and bragging. Share accomplishments in context. Give credit to collaborators. Focus on the work, not yourself.

> **Balance:** Visibility without substance is annoying. Substance without visibility is invisible. You need both.

## Shaping The Company

Impact goes beyond your role. You can shape Overdose itself:

### Influence Culture
Culture is built through individual actions. How you behave influences how others behave. Be the culture you want to see.

### Propose Improvements
See something that could work better? Propose it. Come with solutions, not just complaints.

### Join Initiatives
Company-wide initiatives need volunteers. Strategy projects, culture initiatives, process improvements. Raise your hand.

### Provide Feedback
Leadership wants to know what's working and what isn't. Share feedback constructively through appropriate channels.

### Recruit Great People
Refer people you've worked with who would be great at OD. Building the team is everyone's job.

### Represent OD Externally
At events, on social media, in professional networks. How you represent the company shapes our reputation.

## Individual Ambition vs Team Success

A tension exists between personal advancement and team contribution. Navigate it wisely.

### The Wrong Approach
- Taking credit for team accomplishments
- Undermining colleagues to look better
- Hoarding knowledge for personal advantage
- Prioritizing personal visibility over team outcomes

### The Right Approach
- Celebrating team wins with genuine enthusiasm
- Supporting colleagues even when it costs you time
- Sharing knowledge freely
- Seeking wins that benefit both you and the team

> **The Truth:** Sustainable career success comes from being genuinely valuable to teams and clients. Gaming the system might produce short-term gains but damages long-term reputation.

## What Great Impact Looks Like

Examples of impactful behaviors:

**The developer** who notices a client's site is slow and proactively identifies and fixes performance issues — without being asked.

**The marketer** who develops a new reporting template that becomes the team standard — making everyone more efficient.

**The designer** who creates a design system that speeds up future projects — thinking beyond the immediate deliverable.

**The strategist** who identifies a new service opportunity from client conversations — creating new business.

**Anyone** who helps a struggling colleague get through a tough period — strengthening the team.

## Your Impact Story

Start thinking about this now: What do you want your impact story to be?

**Not:** "I worked at Overdose for X years."

**But:** "I helped transform [client]'s commerce operation." Or "I built the [capability] that became our standard." Or "I mentored the people who are now leading [team]."

What will you be known for? What will people remember about your contribution?
