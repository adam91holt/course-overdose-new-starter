# Tools & Systems

Every professional needs to know their tools. At Overdose, we use a range of systems for communication, project management, design, development, and operations. Let's get you oriented.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify the main tools used at Overdose
- Understand what each tool is used for
- Navigate our technology stack effectively
- Follow best practices for tool usage

## Communication Tools

How we talk to each other matters as much as what we say.

### Slack
Our primary real-time communication platform. This is where quick questions, informal discussions, and team coordination happen.

**How we use Slack:**
- **Team channels** for discipline-specific discussion
- **Project channels** for client and project coordination
- **Company channels** for announcements and culture
- **Direct messages** for private conversations (use sparingly)

**Slack etiquette:**
- Check your channels regularly
- Use threads to keep conversations organized
- Don't expect instant responses — people may be focused on deep work
- Use @here and @channel sparingly
- Keep messages concise

### Email
For external communication and formal internal documentation.

**When to use email:**
- Client communication
- Formal proposals and documentation
- Things that need a paper trail
- Communication with people outside the organization

**Email etiquette:**
- Clear subject lines
- Concise messages
- Reply promptly (within 24 hours)
- CC thoughtfully (not everyone needs every email)

### Video Conferencing
Google Meet, Zoom, or Teams depending on client preference. Virtual face-to-face for meetings.

**Video meeting etiquette:**
- Camera on when possible (builds connection)
- Mute when not speaking (reduces noise)
- Be on time (respect others' calendars)
- Test your setup before important calls

## Project Management

Keeping work organized and on track.

### Project Management Platforms
Various tools depending on team and client needs. Common options include Monday.com, Asana, Jira, and similar platforms.

**What project management tools do:**
- Track tasks and assignments
- Manage timelines and deadlines
- Provide visibility into project status
- Enable resource allocation
- Document project history

**How to use them effectively:**
- Keep your tasks updated (status, progress, blockers)
- Check in regularly for assigned work
- Use comments to provide context
- Don't create tasks without clear owners
- Close completed work promptly

### Time Tracking
We track time for billing, resource planning, and project management.

**Time tracking principles:**
- Track honestly and accurately
- Log time daily (don't try to remember a week later)
- Use clear descriptions
- Categorize correctly
- Ask if you're unsure how to log something

> **Important:** Time tracking isn't about surveillance — it's about understanding where effort goes, billing clients fairly, and planning resources effectively.

## Design & Creative Tools

Tools for the experience team (and those who collaborate with them).

### Figma
Industry-standard design tool. Used for UI design, prototyping, and design collaboration.

**Even if you're not a designer:**
- You may need to review designs in Figma
- Comments and feedback happen in the tool
- Understanding basic navigation helps collaboration

### Adobe Creative Suite
Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. for image editing, asset creation, and specialized design work.

### Miro/FigJam
Whiteboarding tools for workshops, brainstorming, and collaborative thinking.

## Development Tools

The technical stack varies by project, but some tools are common.

### Version Control (Git/GitHub)
Code management and collaboration. All code work flows through version control.

### Development Environments
IDEs, code editors, local environments. Developers set up their own preferred tools within team standards.

### Platform Admin Panels
Shopify Admin, Adobe Commerce Admin, BigCommerce Control Panel, etc. Where we manage the platforms we build on.

### Staging and Testing Environments
Separate environments for development and testing before changes go live.

## Marketing & Analytics Tools

The performance marketing and data stack.

### Google Analytics / GA4
Website analytics. Understanding traffic, behavior, and conversion.

### Google Ads / Meta Ads / etc.
Paid advertising platforms. Where marketing campaigns are built and managed.

### Klaviyo / Dotdigital
Email and SMS marketing platforms. Customer communication and automation.

### Google Search Console
Search performance data. SEO monitoring and diagnostics.

### SEO Tools
SEMrush, Ahrefs, Screaming Frog, etc. Research, monitoring, and technical SEO.

### Data Visualization
Looker Studio, Tableau, or similar. Dashboard creation and reporting.

## Documentation & Collaboration

Where we capture and share knowledge.

### Google Workspace
Docs, Sheets, Slides for document creation and collaboration. The default for most documentation needs.

### Notion / Confluence
Wiki and knowledge base tools. Organized documentation repositories.

**Documentation best practices:**
- Write for your audience (clear, concise, purposeful)
- Organize logically (folders, tags, naming conventions)
- Keep documentation current (outdated docs cause confusion)
- Link related documents (create connections)

## Security & Access

How we protect data and manage access.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
Many tools use SSO for centralized access management. One login for multiple systems.

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Required for sensitive systems. Use an authenticator app for 2FA codes.

### Password Management
Use a password manager (1Password, LastPass, etc.). Don't reuse passwords or store them insecurely.

### Data Security
- Don't share credentials
- Don't leave sensitive data on public/shared computers
- Lock your computer when away from your desk
- Report security concerns immediately

> **Warning:** Data security is everyone's responsibility. A breach could harm clients and the company. Take it seriously.

## Getting Help With Tools

When you're stuck with a tool:

1. **Check documentation** — Most tools have help centers
2. **Ask your team** — Colleagues often have quick answers
3. **Ask IT** — For access issues or system problems
4. **Search Slack** — Someone may have asked before
5. **Training resources** — Many tools have tutorials and courses

Don't suffer in silence. It's faster to ask than to struggle.

## Tool Adoption Tips

Starting with new tools can be overwhelming. Some tips:

**Focus on what you need:** You don't need to master every tool on day one. Learn what's relevant to your role first.

**Ask for walkthroughs:** Ask colleagues to show you how they use tools. Watching others is faster than reading documentation.

**Practice in safe spaces:** Explore tools with test projects or in non-critical contexts before working on real client work.

**Build habits:** Use tools consistently. Habits form faster with regular use.

**Give feedback:** If tools aren't working well, say so. We can improve or change our tool choices.

## Key Takeaways

- Slack is for real-time communication; email for external and formal communication
- Project management tools keep work organized — keep your tasks updated
- Time tracking is essential for billing and planning — log accurately and daily
- Design tools (Figma), development tools (Git), and marketing tools (Google Analytics, Klaviyo) are discipline-specific but worth understanding broadly
- Security practices protect clients and the company — follow them diligently
- Ask for help when stuck with tools — it's faster than struggling
