## Learning Objectives

- Navigate the organization effectively

## The Executive Team

At the top of Overdose sits our executive team — the chiefs who drive strategy, operations, and growth across the company.

### Group Chief Executive Officer
**Paul Pritchard**

Paul leads the overall business as Group CEO. His focus is on company strategy, major partnerships, and ensuring Overdose continues to grow and evolve. The Group CEO role sits above regional operations, providing unified direction for the global business.

### Group Chief Strategy Officer
**Todd Welling** (Co-founder)

Todd co-founded Overdose and leads our strategic direction. As Group Chief Strategy Officer, he ensures our Complete Commerce approach remains cutting-edge and that we're solving the right problems for clients. Todd's vision shaped the Anti-Agency philosophy from day one.

### Group Chief Experience Officer
**Ryan Delaney** (Co-founder)

Ryan, the other co-founder, leads everything related to customer and user experience. His role ensures that our design thinking, UX practices, and brand experience work meet the highest standards. Ryan's background in design drives our consumer empathy ethos.

### Group Chief Technical Officer
**Nikolai Mouraviev**

Nikolai leads our technical capabilities. This includes platform expertise, development practices, architecture standards, and technology innovation. The CTO ensures we can deliver on the technical promises we make to clients.

### Group Chief Search Officer
**Jason Mun**

Jason leads our SEO and search capabilities globally. This specialized role reflects how important organic search is to commerce success. Having a C-level leader focused on search demonstrates our commitment to this discipline.

### Group Chief Commercial Officer
**Adam Ellington**

Adam leads commercial operations — how we sell, how we structure deals, and how we grow client relationships. The CCO role bridges client acquisition with client success, ensuring commercial sustainability.

## Regional Leadership

Overdose operates globally, and each major region has dedicated leadership to serve local markets.

### CEO Australia
**Laura Jackson**

Laura leads our Australian operations — our largest market. She's responsible for Australian clients, the Sydney/Melbourne/Brisbane teams, and ensuring we maintain market leadership in ANZ.

### CEO Americas
**Jenny Mesdag**

Jenny leads our North American expansion from Seattle and New York. The Americas represent significant growth opportunity, and dedicated CEO leadership ensures we build the right capabilities for this market.

### Regional Coordination

While each region has autonomous leadership, they coordinate globally through:
- Regular leadership meetings across regions
- Shared processes and standards
- Global client account management
- Resource sharing across offices

## Functional Leadership

Beyond executive and regional roles, functional leaders head up specific disciplines:

### Strategy & Client Partners
Lead client relationships and strategic direction for accounts. These are senior client-facing roles that ensure partnerships stay healthy and impactful.

### Creative & Experience Directors
Lead design and experience teams. Set standards for UX, UI, and brand work. Ensure creative output meets quality bars.

### Technical Leads & Architects
Lead development teams and technical direction. Make architectural decisions. Ensure code quality and platform expertise.

### Marketing Directors
Lead performance marketing, email/CRM, and digital advertising teams. Drive results for client marketing programs.

### SEO Directors
Lead organic search teams. Set SEO strategy and standards across clients.

### Data & Analytics Leads
Lead reporting, analytics, and data capabilities. Ensure insights drive decisions.

## How Decisions Get Made

Understanding decision-making helps you know when to escalate and who to involve.

### Strategic Decisions
Company direction, major investments, significant partnerships — these go to the executive team. Most employees won't be directly involved, but outcomes affect everyone.

### Client Decisions
Strategy changes, major recommendations, relationship issues — these involve Client Partners and account leadership. Escalate client concerns through your client team hierarchy.

### Technical Decisions
Architecture choices, platform selection, technical standards — these involve Technical Leads and ultimately the CTO. Technical decisions should follow established review processes.

### Operational Decisions
Process changes, team structure, resource allocation — these involve relevant managers and potentially regional leadership depending on scope.

### Individual Decisions
Your daily work, task prioritization, how you approach problems — you own these. Don't wait for approval on everything. Use judgment, act, and course-correct if needed.

> **Important:** Overdose culture encourages autonomy. You're not expected to escalate every decision. Use the guidance of "what would I do if this were my own business?" If something is clearly within your scope, decide and move.

## Accessibility of Leadership

One thing that distinguishes OD: leadership is accessible.

**What this means:**
- You can message or email executives
- Leadership participates in company channels
- Town halls and all-hands include Q&A
- Hierarchy doesn't prevent conversation

**What this doesn't mean:**
- Skip your manager for everything
- Demand immediate responses from executives
- Ignore chain of command for routine issues

> **Tip:** For day-to-day work, your direct manager and team lead are your primary contacts. Reserve executive escalation for issues that genuinely require their attention or for input they're uniquely positioned to provide.

## Your Manager Relationship

The most important leadership relationship for your daily experience is with your direct manager.

### What Managers Provide
- Direction and priorities
- Feedback and coaching
- Career development support
- Advocacy within the organization
- Escalation path for issues

### What You Provide Managers
- Status updates and transparency
- Early warning on problems
- Engagement and initiative
- Feedback on what's working and what isn't
- Trust through consistent delivery

### Making The Relationship Work
- Schedule regular 1:1s and use them well
- Don't save up problems — raise them as they occur
- Be honest about struggles and mistakes
- Ask for the feedback and support you need
- Help your manager help you

## Org Charts and Reporting Lines

You'll have access to org charts showing formal reporting lines. These are useful but incomplete.

**Formal structure tells you:**
- Who approves your time off
- Who writes your reviews
- Who's accountable for your team's performance

**Formal structure doesn't tell you:**
- Who has expertise you need
- Who influences decisions informally
- Who can unblock specific problems
- Who's best positioned to help with particular challenges

Learn both the formal structure and the informal networks. Both matter.

## Key Takeaways

- The executive team includes founders Ryan and Todd, CEO Paul Pritchard, and functional chiefs
- Regional leadership (Australia, Americas) ensures local market focus
- Functional leaders head disciplines like strategy, technology, design, and marketing
- Decisions are made at appropriate levels — don't over-escalate routine work
- Leadership is accessible, but day-to-day work flows through your manager
- Formal org charts show one dimension; informal networks are equally important

## Next Steps

You understand leadership structure. Now let's look at the actual teams and disciplines — where you might sit and who you'll collaborate with.
