# Living The Culture

Culture isn't what we say — it's what we do. Every day, every interaction, every decision either reinforces or undermines our culture. This lesson is about the behaviors and habits that make someone a true member of the Overdose family.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Identify behaviors that embody OD culture
- Recognize what it means to be a good OD colleague
- Navigate cultural expectations in your daily work
- Contribute positively to team culture

## What Makes An ODer

There's no single personality type that fits at Overdose. We have introverts and extroverts, analysts and creatives, technicians and strategists. But successful ODers share some common characteristics.

### Genuine Care

**About the work.** You actually want it to be good. Not just finished — good. Quality matters to you intrinsically.

**About the clients.** Their success feels like your success. Their problems keep you thinking.

**About your colleagues.** You want them to succeed. You help, mentor, and support.

**About the company.** OD's reputation and success matter to you personally.

This care can't be faked. Either you give a damn or you don't. We look for people who do.

### Intellectual Curiosity

Commerce evolves constantly. Platforms update, consumer behavior shifts, new tools emerge. Curiosity keeps you relevant and sharp.

**Signs of curiosity:**
- You read industry news and think about implications
- You try new tools and techniques without being told
- You ask questions to understand, not just to complete tasks
- You're interested in areas beyond your immediate role

### Low Ego, High Standards

This combination is rare but essential.

**Low ego means:**
- You accept feedback without defensiveness
- You credit others generously
- You admit when you're wrong
- You ask for help when you need it

**High standards mean:**
- You don't accept mediocre work from yourself or others
- You push for better, even when good enough would pass
- You hold yourself accountable before expecting it from others
- You challenge work that doesn't meet the bar

> **The Sweet Spot:** Humble enough to learn, confident enough to contribute.

## Daily Habits That Build Culture

Culture is built through consistent small actions, not big gestures.

### Morning Habits

- Check in on team channels to see what's happening
- Review your tasks and priorities for the day
- Identify what you'll accomplish before end of day
- Connect with colleagues — a quick hello goes a long way

### Communication Habits

- Respond to messages promptly (same day minimum)
- Update your status when you're heads-down or unavailable
- Share progress proactively — don't wait to be asked
- Ask questions when you don't understand

### Work Habits

- Ship things, don't sit on them
- Ask for feedback early, not when you think you're done
- Document what you learn for others
- Look for ways to help teammates

### End of Day Habits

- Update task status and progress
- Flag anything blocking tomorrow's work
- Wrap up loose ends so colleagues in other timezones can continue

## Being A Good Colleague

Your relationship with colleagues matters as much as your individual performance.

### Help Generously

When someone needs help, help them. Even if it's not your job, not your project, not your expertise. A culture of generosity makes everyone better.

**Practical examples:**
- Answering questions in team channels
- Reviewing a colleague's work when asked
- Pair programming or working sessions
- Sharing knowledge and resources

### Give Honest Feedback

Avoiding difficult feedback isn't kind — it's lazy. Growth requires honesty.

**Feedback guidelines:**
- Be specific: What exactly needs improvement?
- Be constructive: How could it be better?
- Be timely: Soon after the work, not weeks later
- Be private: Critical feedback one-on-one, praise publicly

### Receive Feedback Well

How you receive feedback shapes whether people give it.

**Good responses:**
- "Thank you, that's helpful"
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "I see your point — I'll adjust"

**Bad responses:**
- Defensive explanations
- Dismissing the feedback
- Making excuses

### Celebrate Others

When colleagues do great work, acknowledge it. Public recognition reinforces the behaviors we want to see.

- Shout-outs in team channels
- Recognizing contributions in meetings
- Telling their manager when someone does excellent work
- Thanking people who help you

## Navigating Challenges

Cultural integration isn't always smooth. Here's how to handle common challenges.

### When You Disagree

Disagreement is healthy. How you handle it matters.

**Do:**
- Express your view clearly and respectfully
- Focus on the work, not the person
- Listen to understand, not just to respond
- Accept the decision once it's made

**Don't:**
- Attack people instead of ideas
- Relitigate decided issues endlessly
- Refuse to commit because you disagree
- Talk behind people's backs

### When You're Overwhelmed

Everyone hits capacity sometimes. Handle it proactively.

**Do:**
- Communicate early that you're stretched
- Propose prioritization or timeline adjustments
- Ask for help or resources
- Be specific about what you can and can't do

**Don't:**
- Suffer in silence until you miss deadlines
- Say yes to everything and deliver nothing
- Let quality slip without warning anyone
- Blame others for your overwhelm

### When You Make Mistakes

Mistakes happen. Response matters more than prevention.

**Do:**
- Own it immediately
- Explain what happened without excuses
- Fix it or propose how to fix it
- Share what you learned

**Don't:**
- Hide and hope no one notices
- Blame others or circumstances
- Make the same mistake repeatedly
- Beat yourself up unproductively

### When You See Culture Problems

If you notice behaviors that violate our values, speak up.

**Options:**
- Address directly with the person (if appropriate)
- Raise with your manager
- Use HR channels if serious

Staying silent when culture erodes makes you complicit. Speaking up protects the environment we all depend on.

## Culture Across Locations

With offices globally, culture varies slightly by location while maintaining core identity.

**What stays consistent:**
- Our values and principles
- Our Anti-Agency philosophy
- Quality standards
- Client partnership approach

**What varies:**
- Local social norms
- Working hour expectations
- Team traditions and rituals
- Management styles

Respect local flavors while maintaining global standards. When in doubt, our values are the tiebreaker.

## Your First 90 Days

Cultural integration takes time. Here's a reasonable timeline:

**First 30 days:**
- Absorb — watch, listen, learn
- Ask lots of questions
- Focus on understanding how things work
- Build relationships with immediate teammates

**Days 30-60:**
- Contribute — start adding value
- Start expressing your perspective
- Take on more responsibility
- Expand your network in the company

**Days 60-90:**
- Influence — shape your environment
- Bring your unique strengths to the team
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Start mentoring newer colleagues

Don't try to change everything on day one. Earn trust first.

## Key Takeaways

- ODers genuinely care about work, clients, colleagues, and company
- Low ego + high standards is the winning combination
- Daily habits build culture through consistent small actions
- Being a good colleague means helping, giving honest feedback, and celebrating others
- Handle challenges proactively and professionally
- Cultural integration takes time — first absorb, then contribute, then influence
