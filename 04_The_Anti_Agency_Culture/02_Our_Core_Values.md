# Our Core Values

Values aren't posters on walls — they're how you actually behave when no one's watching. At Overdose, our values are distilled into a simple phrase that captures everything: **"Break the rules. Think bigger. Get sh*t done."** Let's unpack what that really means.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Articulate Overdose's core values
- Understand what each value looks like in practice
- Apply values-based thinking to your work
- Recognize when values are being lived (or violated)

## Break The Rules

This is the first principle and sets the tone for everything else. It doesn't mean chaos or recklessness — it means questioning convention.

### What "Break The Rules" Means

**Challenge industry norms.** The agency world is full of "that's how it's done" practices that don't actually serve clients. We question them.

**Reject "good enough."** Conventional work produces conventional results. If you want better outcomes, you have to try different approaches.

**Take smart risks.** Playing it safe is a risk too — the risk of mediocrity. We'd rather try something bold and learn from failure than plod along safely.

**Think independently.** Just because a competitor does something doesn't mean it's right. We form our own views based on evidence and logic.

### What It Looks Like In Practice

- Proposing unconventional solutions that might work better than the standard approach
- Questioning established processes that don't seem to add value
- Trying new tools, techniques, or methodologies before they're mainstream
- Standing firm on recommendations even when clients initially resist

### What It Doesn't Mean

- Breaking actual rules (legal, ethical, contractual)
- Ignoring client requirements just to be different
- Being contrarian for the sake of attention
- Chaos without purpose

> **The Test:** "We're doing this differently because it'll produce better results" = Good. "We're doing this differently just because" = Not the point.

## Think Bigger

This value pushes us beyond incremental thinking toward transformational impact.

### What "Think Bigger" Means

**Ambitious goals.** Don't aim for 5% improvement when 50% might be possible. Think about what would transform the business, not just optimize it.

**Long-term vision.** Don't just solve today's problem — anticipate tomorrow's. Help clients build for the future, not just patch the present.

**Systemic thinking.** Don't just fix the symptom — find the root cause. Look at how all the pieces connect.

**Scale mindset.** Think about solutions that work at 10x the current scale. Build foundations, not just features.

### What It Looks Like In Practice

- Recommending strategic pivots, not just tactical tweaks
- Designing architecture that can grow, not just meet current needs
- Bringing up opportunities clients haven't considered
- Pushing for investment in capabilities that will pay off long-term

### What It Doesn't Mean

- Ignoring practical constraints
- Proposing things clients can't afford
- Dreaming without executing
- Overcomplicating simple problems

> **The Test:** "This will transform their business" = Good. "This is impressive but they can't actually do it" = Missing the point.

## Get Sh*t Done

This is the execution engine. Ideas and strategies are worthless without action.

### What "Get Sh*t Done" Means

**Bias for action.** Don't over-plan, over-discuss, or over-analyze. Move. You can course-correct later.

**Relentless delivery.** Meet commitments. Hit deadlines. Ship things. Follow through on what you said you'd do.

**Remove blockers.** Don't wait for permission or perfect conditions. Find ways around obstacles.

**Results focus.** Activity isn't achievement. Busyness isn't productivity. The only thing that counts is actual outcomes.

### What It Looks Like In Practice

- Shipping work on time, every time
- Not waiting for perfect — shipping good and iterating
- Proactively solving problems instead of flagging blockers and waiting
- Cutting through bureaucracy to get things moving
- Following up and following through

### What It Doesn't Mean

- Sacrificing quality for speed
- Burning out yourself or others
- Shipping broken work just to meet a deadline
- Ignoring process when process adds value

> **The Test:** "We delivered what we committed to" = Good. "We shipped but it doesn't work" = That's not actually getting it done.

## How Values Interact

These three values work together:

**Break the rules + Think bigger = Innovation**
Challenge conventions while aiming high leads to breakthrough ideas.

**Think bigger + Get sh*t done = Impact**
Ambitious goals combined with relentless execution creates transformation.

**Get sh*t done + Break the rules = Agility**
Action bias combined with willingness to try new things creates speed.

**All three together = The OD Way**
Innovative, impactful, agile work that actually gets results.

## Values In Tension

Sometimes values seem to conflict. Here's how to navigate:

### "Break the rules" vs "Get sh*t done"
Trying new approaches takes time. Sometimes you need to use the proven method to meet a deadline. **Resolution:** Break rules strategically, not constantly. Choose moments for experimentation wisely.

### "Think bigger" vs "Get sh*t done"
Big thinking can lead to analysis paralysis. **Resolution:** Think big in strategy phases, then break it into executable chunks. Don't let vision prevent action.

### "Break the rules" vs client expectations
Clients sometimes want the conventional approach. **Resolution:** Propose alternatives, explain your reasoning, but ultimately respect client decisions. You can influence, not override.

## Living The Values

Values only matter if they're lived. Here's how to embody them:

### Daily Habits

**Start each day asking:** "What's the most impactful thing I can do today?" (Think bigger, Get sh*t done)

**In meetings:** "Is there a better way to do this?" (Break the rules)

**When stuck:** "What's actually blocking us and how do we remove it?" (Get sh*t done)

**When things are working:** "What if we 10x'd this?" (Think bigger)

### In Client Work

**Strategy:** Don't just document current state — envision transformation (Think bigger)

**Design:** Don't copy competitors — create distinctive experiences (Break the rules)

**Development:** Don't just meet specs — optimize for outcomes (Get sh*t done)

**Marketing:** Don't just spend budget — maximize ROI (Get sh*t done)

### In Team Dynamics

**Feedback:** Be direct and constructive — no sugarcoating (Break the rules of politeness that hide truth)

**Collaboration:** Help teammates succeed — their success is your success (Think bigger than your own role)

**Accountability:** Do what you say you'll do (Get sh*t done)

## When Values Are Violated

Recognizing when we're not living our values helps us course-correct:

**Signs of "Break the rules" violation:**
- "We've always done it this way"
- Copying competitor approaches without thinking
- Fear of trying new methods

**Signs of "Think bigger" violation:**
- Incremental thinking when transformation is possible
- Solving symptoms instead of root causes
- Short-term focus at the expense of long-term opportunity

**Signs of "Get sh*t done" violation:**
- Meetings about meetings
- Analysis paralysis
- Excuses instead of solutions
- Missed deadlines with no accountability

## Key Takeaways

- "Break the rules. Think bigger. Get sh*t done." is our cultural DNA
- Break the rules: Challenge convention with purpose
- Think bigger: Aim for transformation, not optimization
- Get sh*t done: Execute relentlessly with results focus
- Values work together and sometimes tension requires judgment
- Living values is a daily practice, not a poster on a wall

## Next Steps

Values define what we believe. Now let's look at how those values translate into our actual ways of working — the processes, practices, and behaviors that make OD run.
