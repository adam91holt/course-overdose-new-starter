# The OD Way of Working

Values are philosophy. This lesson is about practice. How do we actually work at Overdose? What rhythms, rituals, and behaviors define the OD experience? Let's get practical.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Describe how Overdose teams operate day-to-day
- Understand communication expectations and norms
- Navigate our approach to meetings and collaboration
- Apply OD working practices to your role

## Speed and Urgency

If there's one thing that defines how we work, it's pace. We move fast.

### Why Speed Matters

**Competitive advantage.** In commerce, speed wins. Brands that can launch faster, iterate quicker, and respond to market changes beat slower competitors.

**Client value.** Faster delivery means faster results. Clients don't pay us to sit on things.

**Culture signal.** Speed demonstrates commitment. When we move fast, clients know we care.

### What Speed Looks Like

- Responding to messages within hours, not days
- Turning around work in days, not weeks
- Making decisions quickly with imperfect information
- Shipping and iterating rather than perfecting in isolation

### Speed Without Chaos

Speed doesn't mean recklessness:
- We have processes — we just move through them quickly
- We plan — we just don't over-plan
- We check quality — we just don't create bottlenecks
- We communicate — fast communication enables fast work

> **The Balance:** "Done is better than perfect" — but "done badly" isn't done at all. Quality and speed aren't opposites.

## Communication Culture

How we communicate is as important as what we communicate.

### Direct Communication

We don't do excessive politeness that obscures meaning. If something isn't working, we say so. If we disagree, we express it. Direct doesn't mean rude — it means clear.

**Instead of:** "I wonder if perhaps we might want to consider whether this approach could potentially be optimized..."

**We say:** "This approach has problems. Here's what I recommend instead..."

### Async-First

With teams across multiple time zones, we can't rely on real-time communication for everything. We default to async:

- Write things down so others can catch up
- Don't require immediate responses (unless truly urgent)
- Use tools that support async collaboration
- Respect different working hours across offices

### Channel Discipline

Right message, right channel:
- **Slack:** Quick questions, informal discussion, real-time coordination
- **Email:** External communication, formal documentation, longer-form content
- **Meetings:** Decisions that require discussion, relationship-building, complex problems
- **Documents:** Work product, proposals, analysis, plans

### Transparency

Information flows freely. We don't hoard knowledge or create information silos. When someone needs to know something, they should have access to it.

## Meeting Culture

Meetings can be productivity killers or acceleration tools. Here's how we try to make them the latter.

### Meeting Principles

**Have a purpose.** Every meeting should have a clear objective. "Let's catch up" isn't a purpose.

**Invite the right people.** Not everyone needs to be in every meeting. Only include people who need to contribute or decide.

**Prepare.** Come ready to discuss. Don't use meeting time to read things you should have read before.

**End with actions.** What was decided? Who's doing what by when? No meeting should end without clarity.

**Time is precious.** Start on time. End on time (or early). Respect people's calendars.

### Types of Meetings We Have

**Standups:** Quick, focused updates. What did you do? What are you doing? What's blocking you?

**Client calls:** Regular touchpoints with clients. Prepared agendas, clear outcomes.

**Working sessions:** Collaborative problem-solving. Bring your laptop, not just your opinion.

**Reviews:** Presenting work for feedback. Structured critique, actionable input.

**Retrospectives:** Looking back to improve. What worked? What didn't? What will we change?

### Meeting Anti-Patterns

Things we try to avoid:
- Meetings that should have been emails
- Status updates that could be async
- Decision meetings without decision-makers present
- Recurring meetings that have outlived their usefulness
- Hour-long meetings for 15-minute topics

## Collaboration Patterns

How teams work together matters as much as individual contribution.

### Cross-Functional Integration

We don't throw work over walls between teams. Strategy, design, development, marketing, and data work together throughout projects.

**What this means for you:**
- You'll work with people outside your discipline regularly
- Your input is valued beyond your immediate expertise
- Understanding adjacent disciplines makes you more effective

### Documentation

Good documentation multiplies impact:
- Others can learn from your work
- You don't have to repeat explanations
- Knowledge persists when people move on
- Async collaboration becomes possible

**What to document:**
- Decisions and their rationale
- Processes and how-tos
- Learnings and post-mortems
- Client context and history

### Feedback Loops

We give and receive feedback continuously:

**Requesting feedback:** Ask specifically. "What do you think?" is less useful than "Does this approach address the checkout abandonment problem?"

**Giving feedback:** Be specific and constructive. What's working? What isn't? What would you suggest?

**Receiving feedback:** Listen without defensiveness. The goal is better work, not defending your ego.

## Ownership Mentality

This is crucial to how we work. You own your work.

### What Ownership Means

**See it through.** Don't just do your bit and throw it over the wall. Care about the outcome, not just your deliverable.

**Solve problems.** Don't just flag issues — propose solutions. "We have a problem and here's what I recommend" beats "We have a problem."

**Take initiative.** Don't wait to be told. If you see something that needs doing, do it.

**Accept accountability.** When things go wrong on your watch, own it. No blame-shifting.

### What Ownership Doesn't Mean

**Doing everything yourself.** Ask for help when you need it. Collaborate. Leverage expertise.

**Never saying no.** Ownership includes managing scope and setting realistic expectations.

**Martyrdom.** Working yourself into the ground isn't ownership — it's unsustainable.

## Remote and Distributed Work

With offices across time zones, remote and distributed work is reality.

### Making Remote Work Work

**Over-communicate.** When you can't tap someone on the shoulder, you need to write things down and share proactively.

**Be visible.** Let people know what you're working on. Update your status. Participate in team channels.

**Build relationships intentionally.** Water cooler conversations don't happen automatically remote. Make effort to connect with colleagues.

**Respect time zones.** Not everyone is in your time zone. Don't schedule meetings at unreasonable hours for others.

### Office Days vs Remote Days

Different offices have different norms around in-office presence. Whatever the expectation in your location:

- When you're in the office, be present and collaborative
- When you're remote, be responsive and visible
- Communicate your availability clearly

## Key Takeaways

- We move fast — speed is competitive advantage and cultural signal
- Communication is direct, async-first, and transparent
- Meetings have purpose, preparation, and action outcomes
- Cross-functional collaboration is the norm, not the exception
- Ownership means seeing work through, solving problems, and taking initiative
- Remote work requires intentional communication and connection

## Next Steps

You understand how we work. Now let's explore how you actually live this culture day-to-day — the behaviors and habits that make someone a true ODer.
