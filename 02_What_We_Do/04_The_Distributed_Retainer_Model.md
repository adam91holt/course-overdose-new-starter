Here's where Overdose really breaks from the traditional agency playbook. Our commercial model isn't just different — it fundamentally changes the relationship between us and our clients. Understanding this model is essential because it shapes everything about how we work.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain the traditional agency commercial model and its problems
- Describe how the Distributed Retainer Model works
- Understand why this approach benefits clients and us
- Apply this thinking to client relationships

## The Traditional Model (And Why It's Broken)

Let's start with how most agencies work:

### Project-Based Billing
Client has a need → Agency scopes a project → Fixed price, fixed timeline → Delivery → Invoice → Done.

**The problems:**
- **Misaligned incentives:** Agency gets paid whether the project succeeds or fails. Once it's delivered, it's the client's problem.
- **Scope wars:** Every change becomes a negotiation. "That's out of scope" is the agency mantra.
- **No continuity:** Teams disband after projects. Knowledge walks out the door.
- **Short-term thinking:** Why invest in long-term success when you're not around to see it?

### Time & Materials
Client needs work → Agency bills hourly → The meter is always running → Client anxious about every email.

**The problems:**
- **Unpredictable costs:** Clients never know what the final bill will be.
- **Efficiency penalties:** The longer something takes, the more the agency earns. Where's the incentive to be efficient?
- **Trust erosion:** Clients feel nickel-and-dimed. Every conversation becomes a cost question.
- **Adversarial relationship:** Clients try to minimize hours; agencies try to maximize them.

> **The Core Issue:** Traditional models create adversarial relationships where agency success and client success aren't aligned. The agency's goal is to deliver and get paid. The client's goal is business results. Those aren't the same thing.

## The Distributed Retainer Model

Our approach flips the script. Here's how it works:

### Fixed Monthly Investment
Clients pay a consistent monthly retainer. This creates predictable costs for them and predictable revenue for us. No surprises on either side.

### Flexible Resource Allocation
Within that retainer, we allocate resources based on what the business needs. Not a fixed scope — a flexible capability that adapts to priorities.

**Month 1:** Maybe it's heavy on development because we're launching a new feature.
**Month 2:** Maybe it's heavy on marketing because there's a campaign push.
**Month 3:** Maybe it's heavy on strategy because we're planning next quarter.

The retainer flexes to where value is created.

### Shared Success
Our best client relationships include performance-linked components. When clients win big, we share in that success. This means we genuinely care about outcomes, not just outputs.

### Continuous Partnership
We're not doing projects and disappearing. We're embedded partners who stick around. This creates:
- Accumulated knowledge about the business
- Trust built over time
- Long-term thinking instead of quick fixes
- Genuine accountability for results


## How It Works In Practice

Let's walk through a typical client relationship:

### Discovery & Strategy Phase
We start with deep discovery work to understand the business. This isn't billable busywork — it's essential groundwork that makes everything else more effective.

### Retainer Structure
Based on discovery, we recommend a retainer level that matches the client's ambition and budget. This covers a dedicated team allocation across relevant disciplines.

### Monthly Planning
At the start of each month (or sprint), we work with the client to prioritize work. What matters most right now? Where should resources focus?

### Flexible Execution
Work gets done by the right people at the right time. If priorities change mid-month, we adapt. No change orders, no scope negotiations.

### Continuous Reporting
Regular check-ins, performance reviews, and strategic discussions keep everyone aligned. We're not just executing tasks — we're driving toward outcomes.

### Quarterly Reviews
Bigger-picture conversations about what's working, what isn't, and where we should head next. Retainer levels can adjust based on business needs and proven value.

## Why Clients Love It

**Predictability:** They know what they're spending each month. Budgeting is simple.

**Flexibility:** Priorities can shift without painful renegotiation.

**Expertise on tap:** They have a team ready to go. No procurement process every time they need something done.

**Aligned incentives:** We succeed when they succeed. We're not trying to maximize billable hours.

**Continuity:** The same team works with them month after month, building deep business knowledge.

**Accountability:** We can't hide behind "we delivered what you asked for." We're accountable for results.

## Why We Love It

**Predictable revenue:** We know what's coming in each month. This lets us invest in people and capability.

**Better relationships:** We're partners, not vendors. The conversations are different.

**More interesting work:** Long-term relationships mean we can think bigger. We're not just doing tasks — we're building businesses.

**Actual impact:** We get to see results over time. That's more satisfying than shipping and forgetting.

**Trust-based work:** Less time on proposals, negotiations, and justifications. More time on actual work.

## The Trade-offs (Honesty Time)

This model isn't perfect for every situation:

**Not for one-off projects:** If a client genuinely just needs a single deliverable and never wants to see us again, project-based might make more sense.

**Requires client commitment:** Retainers are ongoing relationships. Some clients aren't ready for that.

**Flexibility can feel loose:** Clients used to rigid scopes sometimes struggle with the fluidity. "What exactly am I getting?" needs to be answered with "the right work, not a fixed list."

**Long sales cycle:** It takes longer to close retainer relationships because the commitment is bigger.

> **Important:** We're not dogmatic about this. Some client situations genuinely call for project-based work. But our best, most successful relationships are built on the retainer model.

## Your Role In This Model

Understanding the Distributed Retainer Model helps you:

**Think long-term:** You're not just doing today's task. You're building a business relationship. Invest accordingly.

**Be flexible:** Priorities shift. That's normal, not a problem. Roll with it.

**Focus on outcomes:** The question isn't "did I complete the task?" but "did I create value?" Different bar.

**Communicate proactively:** In a partnership model, communication matters more. Keep clients informed. Flag issues early.

**Care about their business:** This isn't a vendor relationship where you deliver and forget. You're invested in their success.

## Questions Clients Ask

**"What if I don't need work one month?"**
We'll find ways to add value. There's always optimization, planning, or preparation work that creates future impact.

**"What if I need more than the retainer covers?"**
We discuss expanding the retainer or handling overflow. No surprises — we plan together.

**"How do I know I'm getting value?"**
Regular reporting, outcome tracking, and transparent communication. If value isn't being delivered, we need to fix that or part ways.

**"Can I reduce the retainer?"**
If business needs change, we adjust. We'd rather right-size a relationship than lose a good client.

## Key Takeaways

- Traditional project-based models create misaligned incentives
- The Distributed Retainer Model provides predictable costs with flexible delivery
- We allocate resources based on business needs, not rigid scope
- Long-term relationships enable accumulated knowledge and genuine accountability
- Your job is to create value, not just complete tasks
