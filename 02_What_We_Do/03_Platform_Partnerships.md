Every ecommerce business runs on a platform. Understanding the major platforms — their strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases — is essential knowledge at Overdose. We're not platform-religious; we're platform-strategic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Describe the major ecommerce platforms we work with
- Understand each platform's strengths and ideal use cases
- Explain what our partner status means
- Navigate platform conversations with clients

## Our Platform Philosophy

Before we dive into specific platforms, let's talk about how we think about technology choices.

**We're technology-agnostic.** This means we don't push clients toward a specific platform because we make more money from it or because it's the only thing we know. We recommend what's right for the business.

**Platform fit matters.** A platform that's perfect for one business might be terrible for another. Size, complexity, budget, team capability, growth plans — all of these factors influence the right choice.

**No platform is perfect.** They all have trade-offs. Anyone who tells you otherwise is selling something.

> **Important:** Your job isn't to be a platform evangelist. It's to help clients succeed on whatever platform makes sense for them.

## Shopify Plus


### What It Is
Shopify Plus is Shopify's enterprise offering. It's a hosted SaaS platform that handles infrastructure, security, and updates automatically. Clients pay a monthly fee and get a fully managed environment.

### Our Partnership
We've been a Shopify Plus Solutions Partner since 2013 — back when Shopify Plus was just getting started. Our long history means deep expertise and direct relationships with Shopify's team.

### Ideal For:
- Brands that want to move fast without managing infrastructure
- D2C businesses with relatively straightforward requirements
- Companies that value ease of use over unlimited customization
- Businesses growing quickly that need scalability without complexity

### Strengths:
- Incredibly easy to use for non-technical teams
- Massive app ecosystem for extending functionality
- Handles scale and security automatically
- Fast time-to-market for launches and changes
- Strong community and support resources

### Considerations:
- Customization has limits compared to open-source platforms
- Transaction fees add up at high volume (though negotiable at Plus level)
- Some complex B2B requirements are harder to meet
- Multi-store and internationalization can get complicated

### When We Recommend It:
"You want to focus on your business, not your technology. You need something that works out of the box with minimal IT overhead."

## Adobe Commerce (Magento)

### What It Is
Adobe Commerce (formerly Magento) is an enterprise ecommerce platform that offers both on-premise and cloud versions. It's highly customizable and handles complex requirements well.

### Our Partnership
We're an Adobe Commerce Partner of the Year — multiple times. Our team includes certified developers and solution architects who can handle the most demanding implementations.

### Ideal For:
- Enterprise businesses with complex requirements
- Companies needing deep customization
- B2B commerce with sophisticated pricing and account structures
- Multi-brand, multi-region, multi-currency operations

### Strengths:
- Extremely flexible and customizable
- Handles complex catalog and pricing scenarios
- Strong B2B capabilities out of the box
- Robust multi-store and internationalization support
- Open-source heritage means large developer community

### Considerations:
- Higher total cost of ownership than SaaS platforms
- Requires more technical expertise to manage
- Implementations take longer and cost more
- Ongoing maintenance and updates are significant

### When We Recommend It:
"You have complex requirements that simpler platforms can't meet. You have the budget and technical resources to do this properly."

## BigCommerce

### What It Is
BigCommerce is a SaaS platform that positions itself between Shopify's ease of use and Adobe Commerce's flexibility. It's enterprise-capable while remaining relatively accessible.

### Our Partnership
We're an Elite Partner — the highest tier — which we achieved within months of adopting the platform in 2018. We've delivered numerous complex enterprise builds on BigCommerce.

### Ideal For:
- Mid-market businesses that need more than Shopify but less than Adobe Commerce
- Companies that want SaaS simplicity with more flexibility
- Businesses with B2B and B2C requirements
- Brands that need headless capabilities without full composable complexity

### Strengths:
- More built-in features than Shopify without apps
- Strong API for headless and custom implementations
- No transaction fees (differentiator vs Shopify)
- Good balance of flexibility and manageability
- Solid B2B capabilities

### Considerations:
- Smaller app ecosystem than Shopify
- Less market awareness means smaller talent pool
- Some advanced features require technical implementation
- Not as suited for very simple or very complex scenarios

### When We Recommend It:
"You've outgrown simpler platforms but don't need (or can't afford) full enterprise complexity. You want flexibility without managing infrastructure."

## Commercetools

### What It Is
Commercetools is a headless, API-first commerce platform. It provides backend commerce functionality without a frontend — you build (or choose) your own presentation layer.

### Our Partnership
We're certified Commercetools partners, positioning us for the growing composable commerce market.

### Ideal For:
- Enterprises pursuing composable architecture
- Businesses wanting to decouple frontend from backend
- Companies with strong technical teams who want maximum flexibility
- Brands planning omnichannel experiences (web, app, in-store, IoT)

### Strengths:
- Maximum flexibility and customization
- API-first means integrate with anything
- Frontend-agnostic — use React, Vue, whatever
- Built for modern, microservices architecture
- Handles massive scale

### Considerations:
- Requires significant technical capability
- Higher implementation costs and complexity
- No out-of-the-box frontend (by design)
- Smaller ecosystem than monolithic platforms
- Overkill for many businesses

### When We Recommend It:
"You're building for the future with a best-of-breed approach. You have the technical team and budget to do composable properly."

## Platform Selection: The Real Conversation

When clients ask "which platform should we use?" — the answer is always "it depends."

**Questions we ask:**
- What's your current platform and what's wrong with it?
- What's your budget for implementation and ongoing operation?
- How complex is your catalog and pricing?
- Do you have in-house technical capability?
- What's your growth plan over the next 3-5 years?
- How important is time-to-market?
- What integrations do you need?

> **Tip:** Never lead with platform recommendations. Lead with understanding the business. The platform conversation comes after you understand the requirements.

## Technology Partners Beyond Platforms
