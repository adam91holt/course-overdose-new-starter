Now let's get into the details. Each of our six service pillars has specific capabilities, methodologies, and specialists. Whether you're working in one of these areas or collaborating with teams who do, understanding what each pillar actually delivers is essential.

## Strategy

Strategy is where every engagement starts (or should start). Before we build, design, or optimize anything, we need to understand the business context.

### What Strategy Does:
- **Discovery workshops:** Deep dives into client business models, challenges, and opportunities
- **Market analysis:** Understanding the competitive landscape and market dynamics
- **Customer research:** Who are the customers? What do they need? What stops them from buying?
- **Roadmap development:** Prioritized plans that balance quick wins with long-term transformation
- **Commercial modeling:** Building the business case for investments

### The Strategy Approach:
Our strategists are obsessed with "why" before "what." They push back on assumptions, question briefs, and dig until they understand the real problems. Half the time, what clients think they need isn't what they actually need.

> **Strategy Philosophy:** "We diagnose before we prescribe. A solution without understanding is just an expensive guess."

### Who Works in Strategy:
Commerce Strategists, Client Partners, Business Analysts


## UX/UI & Conversion Rate Optimization

Experience is where strategy becomes tangible. This pillar designs how customers interact with brands across digital touchpoints.

- **Conversion optimization:** Data-driven improvements to increase conversion rates
- **User testing:** Real feedback from real users to validate design decisions
- **Mobile experience:** Designing for the device most customers actually use

### The UX Approach:
Our designers don't design in isolation. They're in constant dialogue with strategy (what are we trying to achieve?), technology (what's actually buildable?), and data (what's working?). Beautiful but ineffective design is just expensive art.

> **UX Philosophy:** "We design experiences that work beautifully — not just beautiful experiences."

### Who Works in UX/UI & CRO:

- **Migrations:** Moving from one platform to another without breaking everything

### The Technology Approach:
Our developers think like business people, not just coders. They understand that clean code matters less than commerce outcomes. That said, they also know that sloppy architecture creates technical debt that kills businesses slowly.

> **Tech Philosophy:** "We build for the business, not the portfolio. Every line of code should serve a commercial purpose."

## How Pillars Work Together: An Example

Let's walk through how these pillars collaborate on a typical project:

**Scenario:** A fashion brand wants to increase online revenue.

1. **Strategy** discovers that the brand has strong traffic but poor conversion. Customer research reveals checkout friction.

2. **UX/UI** redesigns the checkout flow based on strategy findings. They prototype solutions and test with real users.

3. **Technology** implements the new checkout, including updated payment integrations.

4. **Data** sets up enhanced tracking to measure the impact of changes.

5. **Marketing** adjusts campaigns to take advantage of improved conversion rates — more traffic is now viable.

6. **SEO** optimizes product pages that were previously underperforming in search.

No pillar works alone. Every improvement creates opportunities for others.
