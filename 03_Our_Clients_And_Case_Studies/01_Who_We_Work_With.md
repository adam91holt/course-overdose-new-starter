# Who We Work With

Overdose works with brands that want to grow. That sounds generic, but it's actually specific — we're not for everyone, and not everyone is for us. Understanding who our ideal clients are helps you recognize good opportunities and navigate client relationships effectively.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Describe the types of businesses we work with
- Identify characteristics of ideal Overdose clients
- Understand why certain clients aren't a good fit
- Recognize patterns across our client portfolio

## Our Client Profile

Let's start with who typically engages Overdose:

### B2C Retailers
The core of our client base. These are consumer-facing brands selling products directly to customers through ecommerce channels. Think fashion, footwear, beauty, homewares, lifestyle products.

**What they need from us:**
- Ecommerce platform builds and optimization
- Performance marketing that drives revenue
- Conversion optimization to maximize every visit
- Customer retention strategies

### B2B Organizations
Growing portion of our work. These are businesses selling to other businesses — often with complex pricing, account structures, and approval workflows.

**What they need from us:**
- Platforms that handle B2B complexity
- Digital transformation of traditional sales processes
- Customer portals and self-service capabilities
- Integration with back-office systems

### Omnichannel Brands
Brands that sell through multiple channels — online, in-store, wholesale, marketplace. The complexity of managing unified commerce across touchpoints is where we add significant value.

**What they need from us:**
- Unified commerce architecture
- Inventory and order management across channels
- Consistent customer experience everywhere
- Data integration and single customer view

## The Common Thread

What do all our best clients have in common? A few things:

### Ambition
Our clients want to grow. They're not looking to maintain the status quo — they're looking to transform, scale, and win. This ambition drives the kind of work we do best.

### Investment Mindset
They see digital commerce as an investment, not an expense. They're willing to put resources behind their ambitions because they understand the return potential.

### Partnership Orientation
They want a partner, not a vendor. They're open to genuine collaboration, strategic input, and long-term relationships — not just task execution.

### Complexity
Their challenges require expertise. Simple websites and basic campaigns aren't what they need. They have real problems that require real solutions.

> **Important:** We're not the right fit for everyone. Clients looking for the cheapest option, unwilling to invest in strategy, or expecting miracles overnight will be frustrated. And so will we.

## Scale and Stage

We work across a range of business sizes, but the sweet spot is:

### Mid-Market to Enterprise
- Annual revenue typically $10M+ (often significantly more)
- Established business with real operations
- Marketing budget sufficient to actually drive growth
- Technical infrastructure or willingness to invest in it

### Growth-Stage Brands
- Smaller revenue but venture-backed or well-funded
- Aggressive growth targets
- Need to scale quickly and professionally
- Willing to invest ahead of revenue

We generally don't work with:
- Very early-stage startups without budget
- Small businesses looking for low-cost solutions
- One-person operations needing basic sites

This isn't snobbery — it's about fit. Our capabilities and model are designed for a certain scale of work. Applying enterprise-grade solutions to small problems doesn't serve anyone.

## Geographic Distribution

Our clients are spread globally, with concentrations in:

**Australia & New Zealand:** Our home market. Deep relationships with major retailers and growing brands across ANZ.

**North America:** Significant and growing presence. Working with US and Canadian brands, particularly in fashion and lifestyle.

**Southeast Asia:** Emerging market with brands embracing digital commerce.

**Europe:** Select relationships, often with brands that have APAC or US presence.

## Industries We Know Well

While we work across sectors, we have particular depth in:

### Fashion & Apparel
From footwear to clothing to accessories. We understand the seasonal rhythms, the importance of brand, the complexity of sizing and returns, and the visual nature of the category.

**Notable clients:** Overland Footwear Group, SABA, David Lawrence, Standard Issue

### Footwear
A specialty within fashion. Complex sizing, high return rates, brand-driven purchasing, and omnichannel considerations.

**Notable clients:** Overland Footwear Group, FRANKIE4

### Beauty & Personal Care
High-margin products with strong brand loyalty. Subscription potential, replenishment cycles, and heavy emphasis on content and community.

**Notable clients:** ECOYA, Aotea Made

### Homewares & Furniture
Higher price points, longer consideration cycles, delivery complexity, and showroom/online coordination.

**Notable clients:** James Lane, Sleeping Giant

### Outdoor & Sports
Technical products with passionate communities. Content-heavy marketing and strong seasonality.

**Notable clients:** Kokatat, Amer Sports Group

### Health & Wellness
Growing category with regulatory considerations. Trust and credibility are paramount.

**Notable clients:** Manage My Health, Tupperware Australia

## What Makes A Great Client Relationship

Beyond industry and size, certain qualities make client relationships thrive:

### Clear Decision-Making
Clients with clear authority to make decisions move faster. Endless approval chains slow everything down.

### Collaborative Spirit
Clients who treat us as partners get better results. Those who see us as order-takers miss the value we can add.

### Realistic Expectations
Understanding that great work takes time and investment. No magic wands, no miracles overnight.

### Communication
Regular engagement, quick feedback, and open dialogue. Radio silence kills momentum.

### Trust
Willingness to take our recommendations seriously. That's why they hired experts.

> **Tip:** When you're working with a client who exhibits these qualities, nurture that relationship. When you're working with a difficult client, remember that not every relationship is meant to last forever.

## Red Flags

Sometimes clients aren't right for us. Warning signs include:

- Unrealistic expectations about timelines or results
- Unwillingness to invest appropriately
- Adversarial attitude toward agency relationships
- Decision-making paralysis
- Constant scope creep without budget adjustment
- Poor communication or disappearing stakeholders

We'd rather have fewer great clients than many difficult ones. Quality over quantity.

## Key Takeaways

- Common characteristics: ambition, investment mindset, partnership orientation
- We work best with mid-market to enterprise scale businesses
- Deep expertise in fashion, footwear, beauty, homewares, and outdoor
