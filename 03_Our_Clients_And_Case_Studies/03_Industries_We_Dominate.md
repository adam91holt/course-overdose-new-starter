## Fashion & Apparel

This is our heartland. From streetwear to premium fashion, we've worked with brands across the style spectrum.

### Why Fashion Is Complex

**Seasonality:** Fashion runs on cycles — new collections drop, old inventory needs to move, and timing is everything. Marketing calendars are locked months in advance.

**Visual-First Category:** Customers buy what looks good. Photography, styling, and presentation are essential, not nice-to-haves.

**Size and Fit:** The #1 reason for returns. Getting sizing information right, including fit guides and user reviews, reduces costly returns.

**Brand Position:** Fashion is as much about identity as utility. The website experience must reinforce brand positioning.

**Speed to Market:** Fast fashion trained consumers to expect new. Even premium brands need to update frequently.

### How We Win in Fashion

- UX that showcases product beautifully while driving conversion
- Marketing strategies tuned to fashion calendars and trends
- Technical solutions for complex sizing, variants, and returns
- SEO that captures fashion searches without compromising brand voice
- Data insights on customer behavior and product performance

## Footwear

A specialty within fashion that deserves its own focus. Shoes have unique challenges that require specific expertise.

### Why Footwear Is Unique

**Sizing Complexity:** Unlike apparel where sizing is relatively consistent, shoe sizes vary wildly between brands, styles, and even individual lasts.

**High Return Rates:** When fit matters this much, customers order multiple sizes and return what doesn't work. Returns can exceed 30-40%.

**Brand Loyalty:** When customers find a brand that fits, they stick with it. Building that initial trial is the challenge.

**Price Points:** From $50 sneakers to $500 boots, the category spans wide. Customer expectations vary accordingly.

**Omnichannel Intensity:** Customers want to try before they buy. Online-to-store and store-to-online journeys are common.

### How We Win in Footwear

- Rich product information including detailed fit guides
- Returns processes that minimize cost and maximize customer satisfaction
- Loyalty programs that reward repeat purchases
- Omnichannel integration for seamless try-before-you-buy
- Size recommendation tools and customer reviews highlighting fit

## Beauty & Personal Care

High-margin, high-loyalty category with passionate customers and significant content requirements.

### Why Beauty Is Special

**Discovery-Driven:** Customers love discovering new products. Content, influencers, and community drive awareness more than search.

**Replenishment Cycles:** Unlike fashion, beauty products get used up. Subscription and replenishment programs make sense.

**Ingredient Awareness:** Modern consumers want to know what's in their products. Transparency matters.

**Visual Content:** Before/after shots, tutorials, and user-generated content are essential selling tools.

**Fragmentation:** The market spans mass to prestige, with different customer expectations at each level.

### How We Win in Beauty

- Content-rich experiences that support product discovery
- Subscription and replenishment automation
- Influencer and UGC integration
- Personalized recommendations based on skin type, concerns, etc.
- Loyalty programs that drive repeat purchase

## Homewares & Furniture

Higher price points, longer consideration cycles, and significant logistics complexity make this category distinct.

### Why Homewares Is Challenging

**High Consideration:** A couch isn't an impulse buy. Customers research extensively before committing.

**Delivery Complexity:** Large items require special handling. Delivery experience significantly impacts satisfaction.

**Room Visualization:** Customers struggle to imagine how pieces will look in their space. AR and visualization tools help.

**Returns Difficulty:** Returning a sofa isn't like returning a shirt. Processes need to account for this.

**Showroom Integration:** Many customers want to see and touch before buying. Online-to-showroom journeys matter.

### How We Win in Homewares

- Rich product content including room scenes and dimensions
- Delivery experience management and communication
- Visualization tools where appropriate
- Lead capture for high-consideration items
- Showroom integration for omnichannel journeys

## Outdoor & Sports

Technical products sold to passionate communities who research deeply and value authenticity.

### Why Outdoor Is Unique

**Technical Specifications:** Customers want detailed specs — materials, performance ratings, compatibility.

**Passionate Communities:** Outdoor enthusiasts are deeply engaged. They read reviews, watch videos, and participate in communities.

**Seasonality:** Different sports have different seasons. Inventory and marketing calendars vary by activity.

**Authenticity:** This audience sniffs out inauthenticity instantly. Brand voice must be genuine.

**Gear as Identity:** What you use says who you are. Brand association matters beyond functionality.

### How We Win in Outdoor

- Technical content that satisfies specification-hungry customers
- Community integration and user-generated content
- Seasonal marketing strategies
- Authentic brand voice and storytelling
- Integration with activity-specific platforms and communities

## Health & Wellness

Growing category with regulatory considerations and trust as the paramount concern.

### Why Health Is Sensitive

**Trust Is Everything:** Customers must trust the brand and products before putting them in/on their bodies.

**Regulatory Complexity:** Health claims are regulated. Marketing must be careful and compliant.

**Education Required:** Complex products need explanation. Content must inform without overwhelming.

**Privacy Concerns:** Health-related purchases are sensitive. Data handling must be impeccable.

**Recurring Revenue Potential:** Many wellness products are ongoing. Subscription models fit naturally.

### How We Win in Health & Wellness

- Trust-building content and social proof
- Compliant marketing and claims management
- Educational content that supports purchase decisions
- Secure, privacy-conscious data handling
- Subscription and replenishment programs
